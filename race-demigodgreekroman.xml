			<p class="flavor">Being a demigod is no easy task, you can’t really use the internet, nor the phone, heck, you’re getting chased by monsters almost all the time if you found out that you’re a demigod yourself.</p>
			<h4>DEMIGOD TRAITS</h4>
			<p>These are the traits of a demigod:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your ability scores each increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Live up to human age naturally.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Romans tend to be more lawful, and Greeks tend to be more chaotic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Demigods vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>ADHD.</em></strong> Most demigods are labled as suffering from ADHD, but its actually a sign of their heightened senses and natural aptitude for battle. You have proficiency with Dexterity saving throws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Innate Power.</em></strong> If your subrace has an ability or spell that requires a spellcasting ability, use that of your spellcasting class if you have one, if you don’t have a spellcasting class, use your Constitution instead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common.</p>
		    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> There are multiple gods that could be your parent. </p>

	     <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Choose Strength, Dexterity or Charisma score to increase by 2, and one other scores increases by 1. Alternatively, you can choose for all three choices to be increased by 1.</p>
	     <p class="indent"><strong><em>Scent of the Three.</em></strong> Due to your father being one of the big three gods ruling over the three major domains, your scent is strong and easily recognizable by monsters, and mythical creatures. Monsters and other mythical creatures would know of your general location once you are within a one-mile radius of them. Furthermore, you roll with disadvantage with Stealth checks when hiding from monsters who have the ability to smell.</p>
	     <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lightning Legacy.</em></strong> You have resistance to lightning damage and you know the <i>Shocking Grasp</i> cantrip. You may use an action to summon lightning to blast a line of lightning 5 ft wide, 30 ft long from you. Each creature within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, they take 2d6 points of lightning damage and cannot make a reaction on a failure, half as much on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 10th level and 5d6 at 15th level. Once you’ve used this ability you regain the ability to use it, after a long rest.</p>

Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device, when you make the device make an Intelligence check with your Tinker’s Tools. You can use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. Once you reach 5th level, you may have four devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p>
		 <p class="indent"><strong><em>Clockwork Toy.</em></strong> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a direction specified when deployed. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents. (AC 8 plus proficiency modifier, hit points equal to the Intelligence modifier plus proficiency) You may arm it with tiny weapons, dealing piercing damage equal to your proficiency modifier.</p>
		 <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fire Starter.</em></strong> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action, or one action of your Clockwork Toy if you’ve armed it with the Fire Starter device. It deals fire damage equal to your proficiency modifier, and has a range of 5 ft.</p>

On a success they only take half damage, and is not restrained. At the end of each of their turns they can make a Strength saving throw. The length and damage increase to 30 ft and 2d8 respectively at 5th level, 45 ft and 3d8 at 10th level, and 60 ft at 4d8 15th level. At the start of each of your turns.

If you are in a place of shadows, you may use an action to bring 2 willing creatures along you to travel and emerge from another point of shadows with a distance equal to your (Constitution modifier plus your character level) times 10ft. If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed a Dexterity (Acrobatics) contest against you, or be teleported. The first time that you shadow travel, you make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10. On a failure, your exhaustion level is raised by 1, and the DC is raised by 5 for the next time you attempt to shadow travel. On a success, the DC is raised by 2 instead. The DC resets to 10 after taking a long rest.</p>
