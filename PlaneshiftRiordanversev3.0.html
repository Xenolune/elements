Fought &nbsp;in the woods of Camp Half-Blood, on one side thought to represent the Unions, the Greeks, were &nbsp;fighting against the Romans, who were thought to represent the Confederates. Due to this war that lasted three days that caused immense amount of demigod death, the gods decided to &nbsp;separate the demigods to the two sides of the country, the Greeks, who was assumed to have &nbsp;won, stayed in Camp Half-Blood, whereas the Romans, were moved to the west coast of the &nbsp;country, California, formed their own Camp Jupiter. </span></p><p class="c80"><span class="c11">World War II</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c211"><span class="c0">The infamous war of the world from 1939-1945, fought between the children of Zeus and &nbsp;children of Poseidon on the side of the Allies, against children of Hades on the side of Nazi &nbsp;Germany, ended after the United States of America bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It is after &nbsp;this that the Pact of the Big Three is formed. The pact of the Big Three is assumed to be only a &nbsp;Greek oath between the Big Three gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, seeing that their children &nbsp;are too powerful, that it would be too dangerous, and so the oath is taken to prevent more &nbsp;disasters and wars like World War II, also taken to prevent offspring powerful enough to &nbsp;overthrow them. Mainly the pact is taken to avoid The First Great Prophecy that a child of Big &nbsp;Three would overthrow or preserve the gods. </span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c11">Second Titan War</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The Second Titan War as prophesized in the First Great Prophecy, officially started on &nbsp;December 21</span><span class="c56">st </span><span class="c0">of 2007 at the rise of Mount Orthys on Mount Tamalpais in San Francisco, where &nbsp;the battle between Artemis and the Greek heroes against Atlas with his band of monsters and </span></p><p class="c114"><span class="c14">2 </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">army happened.

One may also pick this class up with backstory similar to &nbsp;&ldquo;being a mortal with clear sight that happens to be a Legacy of Asclepius&rdquo; or something along &nbsp;the lines of that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c202"><span class="c16">Druid: </span><span class="c0">Highly advice against picking this, as it draws more from the Celtic mythological feel &nbsp;rather than the other mythologies.

That&rsquo;s why backgrounds are &nbsp;important. These are how the backgrounds provided in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook can be adapted &nbsp;into the demigod setting. </span></p><p class="c277"><span class="c16">Acolyte: </span><span class="c0">Spent studying religion and worshipping a god or a pantheon of gods, Acolytes in the &nbsp;modern world could be from a highly religious household, or a kid studying in highly religious &nbsp;schools, perhaps could even be found in New Rome, helping out with the temples. It is however, &nbsp;less likely to be found in Camp Half-Blood, as they mainly focus on the combat aspect, and the &nbsp;further they will get to would be Greek Mythology classes, to which would be under study of &nbsp;history. </span></p><p class="c255"><span class="c16">Charlatan: </span><span class="c0">They can be found basically anywhere, be it the conniving kid that had to develop a &nbsp;silver tongue to survive in the harsh high school of the west, or the tricksters who just like having &nbsp;fun fooling around toying with other people. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c16">Criminal: </span><span class="c0">It is unlikely that their ways would last long in any community, but they still exist, &nbsp;growing up in a criminal environment, many can easily fall into joining them, however, they are &nbsp;not all bad, as they are most likely the ones who are able to sneak contrabands into camp. </span></p><p class="c195"><span class="c16">Entertainer: </span><span class="c0">They are most likely found hogging the spotlight during the campfire singalong, or &nbsp;playing their flute through the woods trying to serenade and seduce the dryads, entertainers &nbsp;thrive best when performing. </span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c16">Folk Hero: </span><span class="c0">Grew up in camp possibly? Already going on quests early in their years and &nbsp;winning the hearts of the campers around them, or possibly making them bitter with envy? Or &nbsp;perhaps you live on the streets, and fought against monsters that threaten the others&rsquo; lives, &nbsp;stepping in against all odds, you won, and in the process also won the hearts of the poor, for &nbsp;protecting and helping them out. These are folk heroes. </span></p><p class="c286"><span class="c16">Guild Artisan: </span><span class="c0">They are most likely found in the modern world working for a company instead &nbsp;of a guild, also likely to be found in New Rome, part of a possible craftsman guild. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c16">Hermit: </span><span class="c0">This option would most probably be used for an older demigod, that chose to recluse &nbsp;from not just society, but even his or her community, to go on a spiritual journey of self discovery. They would probably have more knowledge of the wars that happened, depending on &nbsp;the timeframe where your DM wish to interject you in. </span></p><p class="c149"><span class="c16">Noble: </span><span class="c0">Rather than born of noble blood, those with this background would be born to one of the &nbsp;families among the 1% that holds the wealth of the country. Possibly even having influence &nbsp;within the camps due to their wealth. </span></p><p class="c237"><span class="c16">Outlander: </span><span class="c0">Outlanders are no longer as commonly found, the modern version of them would be &nbsp;the hunters, while not being completely isolated from the cities, they possess far more wilderness &nbsp;survival skills than average people. Hunters of Artemis who had been alive for a long time &nbsp;should fall into this background as well.</span></p><p class="c105"><span class="c14">31 </span></p><p class="c282"><span class="c16">Sage: </span><span class="c0">Probably children of Athena and Trivia, pouring over pages of lore, reading up on &nbsp;anything that may prove to be useful, or a researcher, possibly even a history teacher. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c16">Sailor: </span><span class="c0">Less likely to be found in the modern days, their modern counterparts would most &nbsp;probably be fishermen, or part of the crew of a transport ship. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c157"><span class="c16">Soldier: </span><span class="c0">Possibly a modern soldier that has served their time in military, however, this &nbsp;background, most fitting in Riordanverse would be found in Camp Jupiter, as their campers &nbsp;mostly follow rankings and military training, thus, most in Camp Jupiter could have the soldier &nbsp;background. </span></p><p class="c214"><span class="c16">Urchin: </span><span class="c0">Living alone on the streets, haunted and pursued by blasting monsters, this is how a lot &nbsp;of demigods end up after running away or losing their family to monsters or rather &lsquo;unfortunate &nbsp;accidents&rsquo; as the mortals would call it. Most with this background is hardened from the time &nbsp;traveling on the streets, as the others who could not get through it would have already died to the &nbsp;cold, starvation, or the teeth and claws of the monsters.</span></p><p class="c110"><span class="c14">32 </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c11">Feats</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c16">Clearsight </span></p><p class="c154"><span class="c6">Prerequisite</span><span class="c0">: Human </span></p><p class="c253"><span class="c0">Increase one ability score of your choice by 1. </span></p><p class="c95"><span class="c0">You have the ability to tell apart reality and the mist, you can see gods and monsters as they are. &nbsp;You see through spells 5th level and lower from the school of illusion. </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c16">Oracle of Delphi </span></p><p class="c301"><span class="c6">Prerequisite</span><span class="c0">: Clearsight, no one else is the Oracle of Delphi, Apollo&rsquo;s choosing (DM&rsquo;s &nbsp;discretion) </span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">You have truesight for as far as you can see. You can occasionally be possessed by the spirit of &nbsp;Delphi to tell a prophecy.</span></p><p class="c113"><span class="c14">33 </span></p></div></body></html>
